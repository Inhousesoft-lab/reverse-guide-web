# Footer Styling Guide

## Structure of Class Names

The BEM-like (Block Element Modifier) naming convention used here is a popular and effective way to organize CSS classes. It provides a clear, logical structure that makes the code more readable and maintainable.

### Naming Convention Breakdown:

- `footer`: The main block
- `footer__container`, `footer__logo`, `footer__info`, etc.: Elements within the footer block
- `footer__text-item`, `footer__link`, etc.: Specific elements that might be reused in different contexts within the footer

This structure allows for easy identification of components and their relationships, making it simpler to style and modify elements without unintended side effects.

If you're happy with this structure, you can continue using it consistently throughout your project for a clean and organized CSS codebase.
